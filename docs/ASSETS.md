# Asset policy & provenance ledger

One illegitimate asset can poison the entire project. These rules are strict
because they have to be.

## The rules

1. **Original work, CC0, or CC-BY only.** No exceptions, no "temporary"
   rips, no AI generations prompted to imitate a specific copyrighted work.
   Content from any Grand Theft Auto product (or any other commercial game)
   is banned outright — models, textures, audio, fonts, logos, map layouts.
2. **Every asset has a ledger row** (below) added in the same PR that adds
   the file. PRs with unledgered binaries are closed.
3. **CC-BY attribution** is collected in this file and shipped in the game's
   credits screen.
4. **Size:** nothing over 50 MB per file. Source files (.blend, .psd) stay
   out of the repo unless they are the canonical editable original and under
   the cap; prefer linking a source archive in the ledger.
5. Binary formats route through **Git LFS** automatically via
   `.gitattributes` — verify with `git lfs status` before pushing.
6. Use the **Asset submission** issue template before producing large work,
   so style direction is agreed first (see style notes below).

## Style direction (short version)

Sun-bleached contemporary coastal city: saturated daylight, neon-wet nights,
worn concrete + stucco + palms. Realistic proportions; the stylization budget
is spent on lighting and color rather than shapes. Study reference goes in
`reference/` (gitignored — **never** commit study footage; see
`reference/README.md`).

## AI-generated assets

Allowed only if: the generator's terms permit redistribution under CC BY 4.0,
the prompt did not target a specific artist/game/franchise, and the ledger
row marks it `AI (<tool>)`. Maintainers may reject anything that looks too
close to existing commercial work regardless of provenance.

### PBR material sets (the texture → game-ready pipeline)

A generated *image* is not yet a material. The drop-in convention that turns an
AI texture set into a correctly-wired `StandardMaterial3D` is:

```
game/assets/materials/<name>/
  albedo.png      # base color (sRGB)
  normal.png      # tangent-space normal map (optional)
  roughness.png   # grayscale, red channel (optional)
  metallic.png    # grayscale, red channel (optional)
  ao.png          # grayscale ambient occlusion (optional)
  emission.png    # emissive mask (optional)
```

Build it in code with `PbrMaterial.from_set("res://assets/materials/<name>")`
(`scripts/world/pbr_material.gd`) — missing maps are skipped, and `triplanar`
is available for large surfaces (ground/terrain). This is what a contributor or
agent should call after a GPT-image → texture-set step, so generated assets
render consistently instead of each one being hand-configured. Every map still
needs a ledger row and must be original (not an imitation of a specific work).

| `game/assets/buildings/library/{house_01..04,biz_01..04,mid_01..05,tower_01..05}.glb` (18 buildings) | Tier-C building library: FICTIONAL buildings (Buildify geometry nodes on varied synthetic footprints, per the real-footprints/fictional-buildings art policy) spanning 1-2 storey houses, 2-3 storey businesses, 5-8 storey mid-rise, 15-25 storey towers. Geometry-only GLBs (named slot materials; the shared ambientCG facade sets + per-building tint applied in Godot via `scripts/props/building_facade.gd`). Density recipe applied (dissolve + collapse decimate): houses ~4-5k, biz ~10k, mid ~28-37k, towers ~67-70k tris, all under the 80k/40k budget. Gauntlet-passed; place via `scenes/props/buildings/*.tscn` (facade + night-gated windows), never the bare GLB | project contributors; generated with Buildify by Pavel Oliva (tool, not redistributed); facade textures ambientCG (CC0) | original — generated via the docs/ASSET_PIPELINE.md Blender MCP flow | CC BY 4.0 |
